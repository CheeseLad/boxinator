I did not create this mod, I just changed a few lines in the code to make it compatible with tModLoader 1.4. All credit goes to W1K on the Terraria forums.

A mod in a box to make boxes for boxing.

Adds the Boxinator.
The Boxinator is an item that spawns a basic house, a wooden box with furniture.
It is crafted using 100 of any kind of wood.
Can be researched in Journey Mode.
